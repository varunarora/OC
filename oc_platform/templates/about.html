	<p>A crucial aspect of every individualâ€™s education journey is WHAT he/she learns. It defines not just the instruction and testing, but also each individual and the society on the whole. It is our sincere belief that openness and innovation in curricula is fundamental to moving humanity forward, and affecting positive change in the community. And thus, we are committed to making it happen.</p>

		<h3>Our philosophy</h3>
		<div id="key-panel" class="panel-left">
			<p>A region's economic development is hugely impacted by education of its citizens. While higher education is a major enabler in helping individuals serve in industries, it is really early education, primarily K-12 education, that defines the motivations and intentions of individuals. These are critical in shaping individuals and societies they are a part of.</p>
			<p>We believe that curriculum, or what people learn during their years of schooling, alongside mentorship, educational environment, etc. plays a vital role in building people's wisdom. Curricula ought to be constantly critically examined, as it defines what we think about and what we do. We have for long ignored it; it needs a renaissance and we need to challenge the status quo.</p>
		
			<p class="bold">Vision</p>
			<p>Our vision is to ensure access to high-quality K-12 education opportunities for every single child in the world. To us, high-quality is as important as universal access is. But it goes further than meeting standards of examination and instruction quality. In our definition of "high-quality", community, innovation and freedom are an integral part.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="fill-panel" class="panel-right">
			<span class="bold">Proudly non-profit</span>
			<p>
				Making profit is great - it allows organizations to create additional incentive for investors to engage in creating value. But we are proudly, consciously and loudly a non-profit organization.</p>
				<p>We believe that profit may come in the way of our mission and the value we create. Not only are we fully committed to re-investing our revenues into the organization and only the organization itself, we are deeply connected to our values and long-term goals. We are driven to giving back in the best possible way we can, while running a fast-growing highly-competitive venture.

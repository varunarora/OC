		<p>
			<ul class="bulleted-list">
				<li><span class="bold">Derivatives & remixing</span>: A CC BY-SA license allows educators, hobbyists and even students to adapt existing content and produce new more innovative works, as collections of existing works or improved or localized adaptions in newer forms. The ability to remix content without introducing toxic licensing terms from a single piece of content gives educators the power to focus on what is most important: better content.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Distribution & publishing</span>: By not imposing a NonCommercial (NC) clause on the content, our licensing allows for a distribution pipeline that is publisher friendly. No publisher may be required to negotiate pricing with OpenCurriculum, as they are allowed to adapt and reuse the content without having to compensate to the community, as long as they attribute the source and share this content under its original licensing.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Honest attribution</span>: Irrespective of the final medium and accessibility of the content, the OpenCurriculum community is always rightfully attributed for their work.</li>
